Practical List
1. Distributed Factorial Computation using RPC
  Description: A distributed application where the client submits an integer to the server using Remote Procedure Call (RPC). The server computes the factorial of the number and returns the result to the client.

2. String Concatenation using RMI
  Description: A distributed application where the client submits two strings to the server. The server concatenates the strings and sends back the result.

3. MapReduce Applications with Hadoop
Description: Two MapReduce programs:
  (a) Character counting in a given text file.
  (b) Counting the number of occurrences of every word in a given text file.

4. Load Balancing Simulation
  Description: Simulates client requests distributed among multiple servers using different load balancing algorithms.

5. Clonal Selection Algorithm Implementation
  Description: Implementation of the Clonal Selection Algorithm, inspired by the artificial immune system.

6. Neural Style Transfer Art Creation
  Description: Applies neural style transfer to create artistic images from given input photos using deep learning techniques.

7. Artificial Immune Pattern Recognition for Structural Damage Classification
  Description: Uses artificial immune system principles for pattern recognition to classify structural damage.

8. Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms with DEAP
  Description: Implements distributed evolutionary algorithms using the DEAP Python library.

9. Weather Data Analysis using MapReduce
  Description: Distributed application that processes weather data from online sources using MapReduce to identify the coolest and hottest years.

10. Ant Colony Optimization for Traveling Salesman Problem
  Description: Implements Ant Colony Optimization to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem, finding the shortest route visiting all cities exactly once and returning to the start.
